I've always wanted to visit my friend! He's not fluent in English, but he does know a few words. This made communicating a problem. We did, however, talk about each other a lot! He knows I'm allergic to dogs, and I know that his favourite colour is green! Before leaving for the airport, he left me a message. He's not much into technology so his crypted message really confused me! Can you tell me what he said?
